Defaults to disabled (no modifier), but allows you to configure it anywhere from 2x (double time) to 8x (bloody insane).

Mod can be downloaded via any of these:
- In game through the mod menu (best option)
- The [factorio mod portal](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/Othyn/Custom%20Hand%20Crafting%20Speed)
- A build can be found in the repo's `/dist` directory.
